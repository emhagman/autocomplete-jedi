# Autocomplete Jedi Package

View and insert possible Python completions in the editor using
`Ctrl-Alt-Space`.
You must have the Python module 'jedi' installed:

    (sudo) pip install jedi

If you have multiple python installations (e.g. python2 and python3), you can
select which python has jedi installed in the settings.

**NB:** Atom has a known bug where settings sometimes won't appear until after a
package has been activated at least once. If you don't see a place to specify
the path to your prefered python executable in the settings, try to trigger
autocomplete-jedi and then check again.

#### *Very basic functionality at the moment*
